Combine matching feature points and contours?


Have x (2d x) and z (2d y) coordinates for 3d
no pre-packaged solutions for cylindrical coordinates

3d z rotation matrix?
With just x and y as x and z and then increment rotation value?

Basically, make x and z planes out of contour maps and rotate 
across z axis.

Depth marker on turntable?

Or recognize table diameter/radius?
